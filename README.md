Error Handling: Unified error logging and standardized error responses.
Configuration Management: Seamlessly load environment variables, secrets, or other configuration data.
Testing Helpers: Easily write unit tests for common Lambda functionalities.
Reusable Utilities: Shared code for tasks like data transformation, validation, or external API integrations.
##Requirements
Node.js 14+ (or the version your Lambda runtime supports)
AWS SDK for Node.js (if youâ€™re interacting with AWS services; typically included in Lambda runtimes, but can also be bundled locally)
